# Lightweight Model Training Project: distilbert-base-uncased

- [ ] 1. Clarify user objective (Completed)
- [x] 2. Prepare environment: Install necessary libraries (PyTorch CPU, Transformers, Datasets, PEFT if LoRA is chosen).
- [x] 3. Select and preprocess dataset: Choose a suitable small dataset (e.g., a subset of GLUE or a custom dataset placeholder) and prepare it for training.
- [x] 4. Configure model and tuning method: Load distilbert-base-uncased, decide between LoRA or classification head tuning, and configure accordingly.
- [x] 5. Implement and run training script: Write the Python script for training, incorporating the chosen method, dataset, and hyperparameters (batch size 1 or 2). Run a small test training loop.
- [x] 6. Validate training results and performance: Briefly evaluate the training process (e.g., loss reduction) and note potential performance on CPU.
- [x] 7. Report and send training script/project files to user: Package the script, any necessary config files, and a README, then send to the user.
